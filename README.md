2. Show confidence and skills in oral communications and presentations.
There are several ways to describe communication with coworkers and consumers, but there are three essential components to good communication:

Listening skills - communication isn't only about getting your message over; it's also about actively listening to and incorporating other people's views. If you've treated others with respect, they're more inclined to listen to you.
Presentation abilities â€” You must be able to clearly explain your facts in order to communicate effectively in the business. Knowing how to put up a decent set of PowerPoint slides isn't enough; you also need to engage and connect with an audience to get your message through.
Tailoring information to the audience - A competent communicator can select what information is important and how to communicate it, but they can also customise that information to the audience. In an informal meeting with close coworkers, you wouldn't use the same terminology as you would when presenting the same information to a group of external clients, for example.

3. Work effectively as a part of team.
Clear and defined goals, as well as team objectives, must be discussed in order to achieve successful teamwork. Setting specific goals will help provide context for the work that each member of your team is doing. The more clearly stated the goals are, the more exact the team's performance will be.
"Friends never let friends down. This realization led to my plan to build a company of friends. First, I had to create and sustain an environment that would breed friendships. Second, I would only hire nice people."
Hal Rosenbluth who built a small, family-owned travel business into one of the largest retail travel chains in the United States
"What matters is working with a few close friends, people you respect, knowing that if times did turn bad these people would hold together."

4. Communicate effectively in a professional context.
Having effective communication skills is vital whether you're sitting in a meeting, attending a job interview, or contacting a customer. It might make the difference between getting your point across and being misunderstood, between finding the dream job and losing out, and between developing strong and good working connections and encountering conflict and difficulties.
5. Define and demonstrate conflict management and resolution strategies.
Conflict management is the practice of being able to identify and handle conflicts sensibly, fairly, and efficiently. It is the process of dealing with (perceived) incompatibilities or disagreements arising from, for example, diverging opinions, objectives, and needs.


Since conflicts in a business are a natural part of the workplace, it is important that there are people who understand conflicts and know how to resolve them. This is important in today's market more than ever. Everyone is striving to show how valuable they are to the company they work for and at times, this can lead to disputes with other members of the team.
Conflict resolution is the process by which two or more parties reach a peaceful resolution to a dispute.But some conflicts reflect real disagreements about how an organization should function.

The resolution of conflicts in the workplace typically involves some or all of the following processes:

-Recognition by the parties involved that a problem exists.
-Mutual agreement to address the issue and find some resolution.
-An effort to understand the perspective and concerns of the opposing individual or group.
-Identifying changes in attitude, behavior, and approaches to work by both sides that will lessen negative feelings.
-Recognizing triggers to episodes of conflict.
-Interventions by third parties such as human resources representatives or higher-level managers to mediate.
-A willingness by one or both parties to compromise.
-Agreement on a plan to address differences.
-Monitoring the impact of any agreements for change.
-Disciplining or terminating employees who resist efforts to defuse conflicts.
